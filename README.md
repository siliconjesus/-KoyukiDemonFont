-KoyukiDemonFont
================

Redditor KoyukiDemon posted an example of her beautiful handwriting.  I and others asked if we could turn it into a font.  This project is to track the creation.

The base idea is to convert the image files into .svg files then convert those vectors into the TTF file.  /u/KoyukiDemon wants the font to be free, so it will be licensed thus.

Anyone needing additional sources, KyoukiDemon stated she will provide whatever we need given a template.  Later on, it would be nice to normalize some of the letters based on multiple samples, and create multiple fonts (thin, heavy, italic, et al).
